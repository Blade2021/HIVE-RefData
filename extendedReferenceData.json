It is super cheap, and when everyone realized that it was much more capable than being just a wifi bridge, people started using it in projects and products.  Espressif heard about what was being done with their chips and started releasing different modules with all of the pins exposed.\n\nThere aren't very many pins, though, and some of them are a bit... quirky to use.  But, because they're cheap, many smart home gadget companies started using them as the main chip in their products.

It was developed by IBM in 1999, and was initially used to monitor oil pipeline sensors and communicate with satellites. It became very popular, and is used extensively in SCADA control systems and smarthome products.\n\nMQTT utilizes a central service called a Broker that can be installed on just about any computer or server.  Clients connect to the Broker to monitor and update various Topics.  Subscriber Clients connect to the Broker and monitor a Topic; Publisher Clients connect to the Broker and update a Topic's value.  A Client can fill either role or both.\n\nHome Assistant and other home automation packages fill both roles, as do most Wifi connected smart plugs and devices.\n\nThere are libraries available in many programming languages (e.g. Arduino and Python) which can be used in custom sensor applications.\n\nWhen troubleshooting MQTT issues, it is useful to use a utility such as MQTT Explorer.",

It enables us to use electronics where there are no electrical outlets nearby and increases ease of management by having power supplies centrally located for devices in hard-to-reach locations.  \n\nPOE comes in three standard flavors:  \n\n1) POE (802.3af) Delivers 15W @ 48V \n2)POE+ (802.3at) Delivers 30W @ 48V\n3)POE++ or 4PPoE (802.3bt) Delivers 60W-100W @ 48V (Depending upon type of 802.3bt used)  \n\nBe certain to review the power requirements of any POE Device prior to purchase to ensure that you're getting everything you need.  \n\nPOE will work with CAT5e, CAT6, and CAT7. As for non-POE installations, care should be taken to not kink or bed the cable too sharply as it will create problems.  \n\nDevices do not need to have ethernet ports!  There are POE Converters that can go from 48V DC to 5V DC or 12V DC, and can be plugged into ESP Wifi chips, or Single Board Computers. ",

    "description": "To learn more about flashing tasmota onto your supported device, check out this article: 🔌 https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Getting-Started/  \n\n🔌 [Current Release Change Notes](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/)  \n🔌 [Tasmota Peripherals](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Supported-Peripherals/)  \n🔌 [Tasmota Commands](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Commands/)  \n🔌 [All Tasmota Releases](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/releases)  \n🔌 [Tasmota Over-The-Air Download](http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/release/)  \n🔌 [Tasmota Special Binaries](https://github.com/tasmota/binaries)  \n🔌 [Tasmota Templates](https://templates.blakadder.com/)  \n\nTasmota is a firmware that can be flashed onto ESP8266 & ESP32 based products and was created by Theo Arends.  It was originally used for Sonoff boards, but quickly snowballed to include *most* ESP MCU chips.  You can use it to control just about everything that you want (plugs, switches, dimmers, bulbs, et cetera).\n\nThe reason you'd load this firmware onto your devices is to keep your smart item traffic local to your premise, and not sending it to the cloud servers.  (So that when the internet goes out, your stuff still works correctly).\n\nTasmota is 100% free and open source making it a great product for the home automation community.\n\nThe community submits configuration templates for devices to a site maintained by a user named Blakadder, so most things are pretty easy to configure.  If you run across a new product without a template, you will need to work out where things like LEDs, relays, and the like are by adjusting template settings manually -- but once you've got it, you can submit it to the repository!.\n\nBlakadder's team also maintains a 'naughty list' of devices that are not compatible.",

Their main business is white-label manufacturing for other companies (be it just the chips, or the entire product), so you'll find Tuya devices sold under many different labels (Martin Jerry and Gosund are a couple).  Usually the product pages on retailer's websites will say that the devices work with Amazon's and Google's voice assistant platforms.\n\nSee also:  {prefix}TuyaConvert",

Zigbee is often preferred to Wifi-based technologies due to its low power consumption and long battery life.  The downside to using zigbee is you need to have a HUB to communicate with all of your devices.  In some ways this is advantageous as it requires fewer devices connect to your wifi network.\n\nOne zigbee hub that has a high approval is the conbee 2.  It is not the cheapest option, but it is fairly easy to configure and always performs very well with devices.  Another great option is the Zigbee2MQTT hub which will relay zigbee data to your mqtt broker.  Whichever hub you select, be sure to verify that devices are supported by your hub before buying as most hubs do not support every device.\n\nIf nothing else, Zigbee is a very powerful protocol that opens the horizon to many types of sensors, switches, and other types of home automation devices.\n\n**CAUTION** Zigbee operates in the 2.4 GHz Spectrum, which is shared with Wifi, Bluetooth, Microwave Ovens, and some cordless telephones.  If you have a lot of 2.4 GHz present at your location, your Zigbee devices may be unreliable.",
