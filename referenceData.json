If you suspect a database problem, the home-assistant_v2.DB file in your config folder can be deleted or renamed to disable it.  HA will rebuild it immediately.  I would wait 10 minutes after deleting (or renaming the file before you restart HA to give the file a chance to rebuild. \n\nüìñ [Official HA Docs on Recorder](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/recorder/) \nüìñ [MariaDB Supervised Addon](https://github.com/home-assistant/hassio-addons/tree/master/mariadb) \nüìñ [WhatAreWeFixing.Today's YT Video](https://whatarewefixing.today/240/) \nüìñ [Official HA Docs on Database](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/backend/database/) \nüìñ [Reddit thread about non-default Databases](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/9z0tof/) \nüìñ [BurnsHA's YT Video](https://youtu.be/4rsxnN8gkHk) \n\nThe default database that is used to store all recorded data in Home Assistant is SQLite.  As you get into a few dozen devices and hundreds of sensor data points, SQLite causes the occasional database corruption. If your Database file is over 1GB, if you are getting Recorder failures in the log, if sensor data randomly stops displaying in your user interface, it is probably time to purge the database. If this continues to happen to you, it may be time to replace the database with something else.\n\n  The easiest way to replace the database is to use the Official Add-on MariaDB.  This is a mysql based program that can handle larger amounts of data better than the default.  \n\nIf you are not running the supervised version of HA, there is a video for you in the links as well.  Also other database solutions will work with Home Assistant, see the link for the recorder integration for more details.",

Low power RF transmitters are allowed to broadcast within these frequency ranges. These small transmitters are usually binary type sensors because only a small message is able to be transmitted during an event. Door/Window sensors, PIR sensors, push button transmitters, remote controls and the like are the typical devices using these frequencies. There needs to be a receiver nearby to pick up these signals and act on the message received.\n\nDevices such as the [Itead RFBridge](http://drzzs.com/RF_Bridge) and the [Bond Bridge](https://bit.ly/DrZzsBondBridge) act as reciever hubs to collect data from these sensors and feed the data back to a program such as Home Assistant for further action.  With some devices like the [Itead Sonoff Slampher](https://bit.ly/DrZzsSlampher), the device can ‚Äòpair‚Äô with a matching RF transmitter bought separately and act on the information provided. Devices are not tied to a common standard (like Zwave) which 1, keeps the price very low, but 2, causes incompatibility between manufacturers.",

The current release of the Tuya firmware has an encryption that prevents the exploit, so it works on fewer and fewer products currently being sold.  If someone can figure out the password....   Or someone at the factory would leak it, this may work again.  At this point only new-old-stock items that have not been used in the Tuya App might work.  Sadly most items will not and None that have been used in the Tuya App will convert.\n\nTHEREFORE......\n\nDon't be shocked when the Tuya Convert doesn't work for you.  The man-in-the-middle attack that Tuys Convert was against Tuya Firmware has been patched by Tuya, and will likely not help you. \n\nFind a way to use the device as is, or find way to take the device apart and flash with a serial adapter.",
