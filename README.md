# HIVE-RefData

## How to contribute?
Wanna help contribute to a short database of useful commands for HIVE?  Check out the example.json included with this repo.  This will give you the json object template that will be used for each defenition.  Then just "fill in the blanks".  

### Installation 
Try to include information on requirements, skills required, or maybe a library?
### Links
The links section is an array object.  So include any links in array format ( ["link.com","link.org","link.net"] )
### Description
This is the meat of the defention.  What is the defention?  What does it do?  How does it help?  Details are key.  (Just remember we do have a character limit so no 10 page essays please.
### Category
Pick a category from below or suggest a new one.  We are trying to generalize everything for easy access so try to be generic.  The category is also an array object so you can use more then one!
### Alias
Does your defenition fit more then just one reference?  No problem, just add any aliases here.
